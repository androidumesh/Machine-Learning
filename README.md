Machine Learning Algorithms in Python and R. 
It is structured the following way:

1 - Data Preprocessing
2 - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
3 - Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification
4 - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
5 - Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat
6 - Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling
7 - Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP
8 - Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks

This project includes both Python and R code templates which you can download and use on your own projects.
